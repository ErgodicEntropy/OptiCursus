# Smart-Curriculum-Manager
## Introduction
The Cursus Sorting Algorithm is designed to help students select the most optimal cursus programs by overcoming challenges such as vaguely similar curriculums with wide quality differences, lacking full observability of the options and imperfect information (bounded rationality) causing ambiguity effect by misleading the decision apparatus. This algorithm efficiently handles complex, multi-dimensional decision-making vis-a-vis incomplete information. The goal is to make the selection process as efficient as posssible up to a given available information capacity.

By leveraging techniques like Gini Index Maximization, Barbell Strategy, and Multi-Factor Optimization, the algorithm reduces redundancy and improves the quality of program recommendations. Additionally, integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) refines the decision-making process, enabling smarter, more context-aware outputs.

Whether you're a student looking for the best fit for your academic and career goals or an educational institution aiming to guide students effectively, this solution simplifies the process, offering accurate, tailored suggestions with minimized computational complexity.

## Product Management
### Problem Statement
Students suffer from having to choose between a myriad of cursus programs in the limits of imperfect information settings, limiting thereby the quality of their decisions which leads to misalignment, and later, burnout. 
### Stakeholders/End Users 
Students looking for a cursus program that is optimal and best aligned with their profile, eligibility and preference or interest.
### Product Roadmap
#### Product Vision
Ensure high-quality decision-making for the students to avoid bad career choices
#### Product Strategy (Project Scope)
Sort out the optimal cursus programs according to the student's profile, eligibility and preference or interest
