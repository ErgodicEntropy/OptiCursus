## System Engineering

### Logical Architecture
![Logical Architecture](diagrams/Logical%20Architecture%20(Level%201).jpeg)
#### Component Analysis

**1. Student Input**
The system relies on two main types of input from the student: **Preferences** and **Profile**.

- **a. Preferences**
  - **Favorite Subjects**: Subjects the student enjoys or excels in (e.g., mathematics, literature, biology).
  - **Career Goals**: Desired career paths or industries (e.g., software engineering, medicine, finance).
  - **Learning Style**: Preferred methods of learning (e.g., hands-on, theoretical, collaborative).
  - **Passions/Hobbies**: Non-academic interests that could influence program choice (e.g., music, sports, coding).
  - **Location Preferences**: Preferred study locations (e.g., local, international, specific countries).

- **b. Profile**
  - **Academic Background**: Grades, courses taken, and academic achievements (CV or Resume).
  - **Skills**: Technical or soft skills (e.g., programming, public speaking, teamwork).
  - **Eligibility**: Entry requirements met (e.g., standardized test scores, prerequisite courses).
  - **Achievements**: Awards, certifications, or extracurricular activities.
  - **Constraints**: Limitations such as budget, time, or accessibility.


**2. System Processing**
The system processes the student's input using advanced algorithms and strategies.

- **a. Multi-Redundancy Elimination (GINI Index Minimization)**
  - **Purpose**: Ensures recommendations are diverse and non-redundant.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Uses the **GINI Index** to evaluate diversity.
    - Minimizes redundancy by recommending programs that cover a wide range of options.
    - Example: Recommends blended programs (e.g., computational finance) instead of only pure computer science or business programs.

- **b. Eligibility Score**
  - **Purpose**: Evaluates how well the student meets the entry requirements for each program.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Calculates a score based on the student’s academic background, skills, and achievements.
    - Ranks programs by how closely the student’s profile matches their eligibility criteria.
    - Example: Prioritizes programs requiring a high GPA if the student meets this criterion.

- **c. Multi-Factored Optimization**
  - **Purpose**: Balances multiple factors (e.g., preferences, profile, eligibility) to find the best-fit programs.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Uses **weighted optimization** to prioritize factors based on their importance to the student.
    - Example: Recommends programs with strong career outcomes if the student prioritizes career goals over location.

- **d. Barbell Strategy**
  - **Purpose**: Balances **safe choices** and **aspirational choices** in the recommendations.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Recommends a mix of:
      1. **Safe Choices**: Programs where the student is highly likely to be accepted and succeed.
      2. **Aspirational Choices**: Programs that are more competitive or challenging but align with the student’s long-term goals.
    - Example: Recommends both local universities (safe) and competitive international programs (aspirational).


**3. Output: Aligned Cursus Programs**
The final output is a list of **Aligned Cursus Programs** that match the student’s profile, preferences, and goals. Each recommendation includes:

  - **Program Details**: Name, institution, curriculum, duration, and location.
  - **Alignment Score**: A score indicating how well the program aligns with the student’s input.
  - **Eligibility Status**: Whether the student meets the program’s entry requirements.
  - **Career Outcomes**: Potential career paths and job prospects after completing the program.
  - **Comparison Metrics**: Key metrics (e.g., cost, acceptance rate, student satisfaction) to help the student compare programs.
